This folder contains the data. 

In the original folder, it has 5 files, separated by continent, of every country's yield and production from 1961 to 2014. The data is a little bit gross and hard to read so I cleaned it up. 

The cleaned folder has 2 files, one for yield and one for production. Each is organized by country and has data for every product that country produced in the time range. 

Yield is defined as the "density" of crop, measured in hectograms/hectoacres. 

Production is defined as the total number of tons that the country produced of that product.
